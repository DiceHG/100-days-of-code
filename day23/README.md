## Overview

### Project

Building the famous chicken crossing game, but with a turtle

- Instead of using a random y from -260 to 260, divided into lanes so cars dont overlap
- Speed increment adjusted to 5

### What I learned

- Using the `turtle` module
- Applying OOP principles in game development
- Controlling object movement and collision detection
- Managing game speed and difficulty progression
