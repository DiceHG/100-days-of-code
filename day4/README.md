## Overview

### Project

A Rock, Paper, Scissors game implemented in Python using ASCII art. The user plays against the computer, which makes a random choice each round.

### Notes

- The game uses ASCII art from [ASCII Art Collection](https://ascii.co.uk/art)
- The game follows the simple rule of Rock > Scissors > Paper > Rock
- Implemented different logic from Angela's for determing the result

### What I learned

- Lists and indexing
- Using the random module
- Generating random numbers
- Simple game logic
