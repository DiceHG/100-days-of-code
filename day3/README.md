## Overview

### Project

Make a text-based adventure game where the player makes choices to advance through the story. Each decision affects the outcome, leading to either victory or game over.

### Notes

- The game uses ASCII art from [ASCII Art Collection](https://ascii.co.uk/art)
- There are 6 possible endings

### What I learned

- Using `if`, `elif`, and `else` statements
- Nested conditionals
- Simple game logic
