## Overview

### Project

Help Reeborg escape a random generated maze using an algorithm

### Notes

- This project was built in [Reeborg's World](https://reeborg.ca/reeborg.html?lang=en&mode=python&menu=worlds%2Fmenus%2Freeborg_intro_en.json&name=Maze&url=worlds%2Ftutorial_en%2Fmaze1.json)
- The maze was solved using the right-hand method
- There are built-in functions such as `move()`, `turn_left()`, and sensor checks
- The `turn_right()` function is implemented using multiple left turns

### What I learned

- `While` loops
- Creating and using custom functions
