## Overview

### Project

A classic Pong game built in Python using the `turtle` module and OOP. The game features a player-controlled paddle and an automated computer opponent.

### Notes

- The game is a player vs computer game
- The computer paddle moves automatically to track the ball
- Ball movement is handled using `setheading()` and `forward()` for directional control
- The ball gradually speeds up as the game progresses to increase difficulty

### What I learned

- Using the `turtle` module
- Applying OOP principles in game development
- Controlling object movement and collision detection
- Implementing basic game AI behavior
- Managing game speed and difficulty progression
